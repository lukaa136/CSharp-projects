**UPDATE** 
I'm currently full focused on CS50X, that's why I stopped uploading things here, but I'll be back with a strong foundation and ready to work.

About This Repository

I'm currently learning C# and using this repository to upload projects that help me reinforce my knowledge.

This serves as a learning journey, so you'll find code at different skill levels—each project reflects my progress at that point in time.g I learned, so it has different levels and skills at different times.

Note: These projects are part of my on-going C# learning journey, but they’re not the only ones I’ve worked on, it's something that i do to show regularity. As I progress, I’ll keep adding more complex examples and refining my skills.
